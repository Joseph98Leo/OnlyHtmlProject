        <p>I have some hobbies, but my favorite hobbies are...</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Play Chess</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dancing</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Learn English</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>Play Chess</h2>
            <p>
                I like to play chess; for me, it's a very strategic and creative game. I learned to play from a very young age thanks to my father, and now I have a good level. I prefer to play chess with a real board rather than virtually, but sometimes I also play virtually.

        <div>
            <h2>Dancing</h2>
            <p>
                I like to dance, at parties or any moment of happiness, or simply when listening to music I enjoy, for example, with the song "El Merengue" by Marshmello featuring Manuel Turizo.

        <div>
            <h2>Learn English</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy learning English, not just for work; it simply piques my curiosity. Although we all know that learning English in the programming world is a plus.
