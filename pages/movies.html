            <h2>Flash</h2>
            <p>
                "The Flash" is a movie that I loved. The humor, drama, and action were incredible, and the unexpected twist when Barry meets his doppelg√§nger, my mind was blown :o

            <h2>Sherk</h2>
            <p>
                Shrek is a movie I adore. Its humor and reinterpretation of fairy tales captivated me from the first time I saw it. Characters like Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona hold a special place in my heart. It's an unforgettable cinematic experience.

            <h2>Spiderman</h2>
            <p>
                One of my favorite movies is Spiderman with Tobey Maguire as the actor, especially Spiderman 3. As a child, I wanted to be Sandman, and I still would like to be him, I mean the power he has since his life is chaotic :(
