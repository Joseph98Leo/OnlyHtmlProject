        <p>I like various videogames, especially computer games, for example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dota 2</strong></li>
            <li><strong>SuperSmash</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Starcraft2</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <main>
            <div>
                <h2>Dota 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Dota 2 is a strategy game, consisting of two rival groups of 5 players per group. Truth be told, this game is good, but the players are sometimes toxic, especially in Latin America.

            <div>
                <h2>SuperSmash</h2>
                <p>
                    Super Smash Bros. is a fighting game where players control famous Nintendo characters to defeat their opponents by knocking them off the stage. I love playing this with several of my friends; it's a lot of fun.

            <div>
                <h2>Starcraft2</h2>
                <p>
                    Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategy game where players command one of three factions to dominate opponents in battles across different maps.
                    I've been playing StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty since its release in March 2010 and have progressed
